As mentioned in the introduction, the presence of population structure in
 the data can lead to false positive associations.
 A common way to assess the degree of population structure in the data is
 to compute the genomic inflation factor λ GC [55].
 It describes the deviation of the median of the observed test statistics
 from the median of the expected test statistics.
 Since the distribution of the test statistics under the null hypothesis
 is known (either because there is a closed form representation, or because
 it has been derived empirically using permutation testing), so is its median.
 Considering the assumption that most of the SNPs are not associated with
 the trait, λ GC should be close to one if no confounder is present [56].
 If λ GC is inflated (larger than 1) or deflated (lower than 1), a correction
 for population structure is recommended to avoid false positives or false
 negatives, respectively.
 The inflation or deflation of p-values can be easily visualized in a Q-Q
 plot (refer to Subheading 2.7.2 for more details about these plots).
